For texts with complex emotions, a quantitative analysis for all\r\nfive emotion modes is significant for the accuracy of the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe emotion analysis module in this\r\nsoftware is based on the AlchemyLanguage service from IBM, which offers a collection of functions and\r\nAPIs for natural language processing and analysis. The Emotion Analysis\r\nfunction can analyze any textual information in English and return the detected\r\nemotions and their relevance values. It can not only analyze the overall\r\nemotions of an entire text, but also find out the emotions associated with\r\nindividual entities or keywords which are also identified by AlchemyLanguage. The relevance values\r\nreturned along with five emotions indicate the confidence levels for each of\r\nthem, making it convenient for developers to quantify the emotions.\r\n\r\nThe emotion\r\nanalysis results returned from AlchemyLanguage are in a _JSON_ format, but they are not native _JSON_ objects. _JSON-java_,\r\na popular _JSON_ package in Java, was\r\nused to convert the emotion results to a _JSON_\r\nobject. This object is parsed to read the values of each emotion and assign\r\nthem to five _double_ variables (_joyValue, angerValue, fearValue,\r\ndisgustValue, sadnessValue_). A method called _getFinalEmootion_ was created in the _GetEmotion_ class to return the most relevant emotion of a text\r\nbased on those five created variables. In this function, a HashMap was created\r\nto store the names and values of emotions. I found HashMap is probably the\r\neasiest way to find the one with the maximum value out of five variables. It\r\ncan be used to find either the maximum value or the key with the maximum, or\r\nboth. If I only need to fine the maximum of five values, I can do a multiple comparison\r\nusing _Math.Max_:\r\n\r\n`\r\ndouble maxVar = Math.max(firstVar, Math.max(secondVar, Math.max(thirdVar, Math.max( fourthVar, fifthVar))); \r\n`\r\n\r\n#### 3. Visualization\r\n\r\nThere are many\r\nsoftware toolkits and libraries available for visualization in Java, including _Prefuse_, _Piccolo2D_, _JUNG_, _Graphviz_, and _Gephi_. Eventually _GraphStream_\r\nwas chosen and used to create interactive visualizations for this project. _GraphStream_ is an open-source Java\r\nlibrary for modeling and visualizing data in the form of dynamic graphs. It\r\nshows dynamic interaction networks for various types of data and handles the\r\ngraph evolution in time. The changes and transformations of the network can be observed while the\r\nprogram is modeling and visualizing data. \r\n\r\n### Software Design\r\nJava, the programming language used for this visualization tool, is an objective-oriented language. The software design was expected to accomplish a high cohesion and low coupling among the fundamental modules of Plexus. Three classes were created to perform the visualization tasks, along with two other property files.\r\n#### 1.\tTwitterVis\r\n_TwitterVis_ is the main class in this software package. The keywords in the Twitter API search query are defined in this class. _TwitterVis_ retrieves the data according to the given keywords and pass them to the _GetEmotion_ class for emotion analysis.\r\n#### 2.\tGetEmotion\r\n_GetEmotion_ submits streamed tweets to the AlchemyAPI service and utilizes a HashMap function to find the emotion mode with the largest relevance value. \r\n#### 3.\tGreetings\r\n_Greetings_ provides a simple GUI for users to input two related topics that they are interested in learning through this visualization. The visualization module will initiate after users hit the “submit” button.\r\n\r\n![ui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xavierwu2016/plexus/master/style/ImagesFromPublication/ui.png)\r\n\r\n####  4. TwitterDevApiKey\r\n_TwitterDevApiKey_ stores all the credential information, i.e. API tokens and keys, in the program. The reason for this design is that putting all keys in the same location makes it convenient to organize and update the license information in this package.\r\n#### 5. Stylesheet (CSS)\r\nThe stylesheet file was created to establish a styling framework for this visualization. All elements’ properties are defined here. Separate styles for users’ actions, such like clicking a node, can also be declared here. The entire stylesheet was written in CSS so that styles of HTML elements can be directly adapted into _Plexus_, a Java program.\r\n\r\n**Vancouver vs.  Los Angeles**\r\n\r\n![vancouver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xavierwu2016/plexus/master/style/ImagesFromPublication/vanVSla.png)\r\n\r\n### Visualization Design\r\nA basic goal of visualizing information is to tell a story or solve a problem. To create an effective visualization, several factors such as spatial position need to be considered. Plexus provides a simple 2D model to have the visualization results presented as a force-directed network graph, in which two clusters are embedded. From the perspective of visualization, force-directed algorithms create graphs that are aesthetically engaging [2] and interactively intriguing. Since the goal of this visualization design is to create a social media data visualization for users without much prior experience or knowledge in this field, \r\n\r\n________\r\n**Redesigned Emoji icons:**\r\n\r\n![emoji](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xavierwu2016/plexus/master/style/ImagesFromPublication/emoji.png)\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n**Hilary vs. Trump Visualization with the new design:**\r\n\r\n![hilaryVStrump](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xavierwu2016/plexus/master/style/ImagesFromPublication/hilaryVStrump.png)\r\n\r\n________\r\n________\r\n### References\r\n1.
